# ProfilePrototype

This is a mini-project created to design a Profile screen from a game application.
The screen should show an image from the current logged user, his game results (number of games played, wins and losses) and list of his friends with some other info.

From the friends list, the user can see who is online and set any friend as a favorite (star icon) or like his profile (heart icon).


### What is used in this project:

- CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, CollapsingToolbarLayout and Toolbar
- RecyclerView and CardView
- RoundedImageView (from https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView)
- LikeButton (from https://github.com/jd-alexander/LikeButton)
